# Lets-Break-This-Repo
A learn-by-doing exercise in using the git command line! Let's mess up and fix this repo!

# Principles
-Being new is ok! Asking questions is ok!
-Messing up is encouraged! The repo was named this way for a reason!
-Messing your repo up so badly that you need to delete the whole thing and start over again isn't a fail state, it's valuable lesson. Get those speed bumps over with now so you don't have to experience them on the job!
-The command line is your friend, but you gotta break the ice first!

# What you need:
-VS Code or similar code editor
-For windows: install Git Bash https://git-scm.com/downloads
-For mac: not sure, will make issue

# Starting:
-Start with the file "1_pull_request_main"
